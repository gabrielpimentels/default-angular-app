I dont really know what i am doing here, it hasnt been the trip that i was expecting. I feel that my past is still influencing in my life in a negative way, it something that even if I address and understand, I cant change, I would like to be differente, I even see where I am failing, but it seems that it is natural to be a weirdo, I think Margherita has something to do with this, My mind is blocked due to the fact that I am married, I am not only married, but stuck in this moment that I spent inside the room, without external contact, I don’t know how to interact with people, my words are not nice, my stories are not nice, I don’t know what to say to people, I am just being my self, what is exacltle the reason why I am here today, fucked mentally, financially and all the other aspects, I am a loser, even if I try to pretend that I am not, I cant, see your last days, you think that is nice to be a weirdo, I know that it should not be a problem, but you also have some age, what counts a bit, you cant deny, depression, anxiety, no experience travelling alone, no experience making friends, no experience being friendly, you are just an old man that never learned how to live, you are an adult kit, or, a virgem, you are the bad thing that I was always avoiding to became, I am something that I don’t link, I hate myself, I am poor and I have no future, I don’t have motivation, I am lost, I don’t know what I am doing, I don’t know where I am going to be in a month, I don’t know if I will go back to Dublin, if I will stay in Portugal, if I will…, if I will back to margherita, if if if. I just don’t know, and this anxiety don’t let me enjoy the present, I feel this shit weight from the past sum with a shit future, I just wanted to turn off, in a natural way would work too, at least people wouldn’t think that I am weak, this is another thing, “what people would think”, come on, fuck off everybody, fuck everything, if you are not feeling to live anymore, just be honest, just give up, people may not understand, but it is your choice, If it will make you feel better so think about, see all the options that you have, fix what you have to fix before you do it, let the people that you love know how you feel, it makes no sense to stay here living somebody elses dreams, people will judge you but they have never been close enough to understand, fuck of judgement from people that never understood you, or even tried, they mean nothing, look where you are right now, prenteding that you are coll, typing without looking at the keyboard, just pretend, create a mask, live another life, noboby knows you, just do it, and in case you fail, what is the problem? You are already a lose, you having nothing to lose, are you ashamed of what? Becaming worst? Hardly possible, don’t you think? So stop having this shit thoughts, stop wasting your life, you have been doing this your whole life, belivieng that you could recover the time wasted, you are not, this time is gone, it will not come back, and you are making you future miserable, not only yours, but everybody else that is close to you, even people that you don’t communicate, now is the time Gabriel, It is time to live or die. You decide.
