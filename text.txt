I dont really know what i am doing here, it hasn’t been the trip that i was expecting. I feel that my past is still influencing in my life in a negative way, it something that even if I address and understand, I cant change, I would like to be different, I even see where I am failing, but it seems that it is natural to be a weirdo, I think Margherita has something to do with this, My mind is blocked due to the fact that I am married, I am not only married, but stuck in this moment that I spent inside the room, without external contact, I don’t know how to interact with people, my words are not nice, my stories are not nice, I don’t know what to say to people, I am just being my self, what is exacltle the reason why I am here today, fucked mentally, financially and all the other aspects, I am a loser, even if I try to pretend that I am not, I cant, see your last days, you think that is nice to be a weirdo, I know that it should not be a problem, but you also have some age, what counts a bit, you cant deny, depression, anxiety, no experience travelling alone, no experience making friends, no experience being friendly, you are just an old man that never learned how to live, you are an adult kit, or, a virgem, you are the bad thing that I was always avoiding to became, I am something that I don’t link, I hate myself, I am poor and I have no future, I don’t have motivation, I am lost, I don’t know what I am doing, I don’t know where I am going to be in a month, I don’t know if I will go back to Dublin, if I will stay in Portugal, if I will…, if I will back to margherita, if if if. I just don’t know, and this anxiety don’t let me enjoy the present, I feel this shit weight from the past sum with a shit future, I just wanted to turn off, in a natural way would work too, at least people wouldn’t think that I am weak, this is another thing, “what people would think”, come on, fuck off everybody, fuck everything, if you are not feeling to live anymore, just be honest, just give up, people may not understand, but it is your choice, If it will make you feel better so think about, see all the options that you have, fix what you have to fix before you do it, let the people that you love know how you feel, it makes no sense to stay here living somebody elses dreams, people will judge you but they have never been close enough to understand, fuck of judgement from people that never understood you, or even tried, they mean nothing, look where you are right now, prenteding that you are coll, typing without looking at the keyboard, just pretend, create a mask, live another life, noboby knows you, just do it, and in case you fail, what is the problem? You are already a lose, you having nothing to lose, are you ashamed of what? Becaming worst? Hardly possible, don’t you think? So stop having this shit thoughts, stop wasting your life, you have been doing this your whole life, belivieng that you could recover the time wasted, you are not, this time is gone, it will not come back, and you are making you future miserable, not only yours, but everybody else that is close to you, even people that you don’t communicate, now is the time Gabriel, It is time to live or die. You decide.







Well, here we are again, after 3 days sick, just in bed, today I feel better, not 100% yet, but way better then before, I am still having 3 days to go before back “home”, I actually have no house, I will need to stay in a hostel for a week or two, what it is not a problem when we compare to our last experience in hostels, the problem is that, in Dublin, the weather is different, there is no many things to do, I will need to work, I wont be able to find a house before having the money to pay, I am think about a month before I finally have the funds to pay for the rent + deposit, my mom offered help to pay, I will need to accept, it will help me to have more time to plan, and I will need to plan my next steps, stop living this randomness, it is time to think about my life and where I want to be in future, I don’t really care about my next job, I just so money, I hope it will not drain all my energy, because in the in the I need to be good mentally first of all, hopefully I will keep this lucky that I have been having during this past week, actually I wouldn’t say it was lucky, I believe I made my lucky, I just need to keep creating the opportunities and in the end good things will happen, I need to focus on studying and next year find a job which will give a future, maybe starting an university, what would be great and would give me more energy and help me to back to trail, also, I will need to make new friends, stop isolating myself, if there is something this trip showed is that, I like to be alone, but I also enjoy peoples company, it is good, not only for me, but also to help another person to have a good day, this is good, I really enjoyed this trip, of course there was things I regret not doing, but it is all right, it needs to be an opportunity to grow, use what I regret as something to be better, you understood that it is better to regret for things that you tried then for things that you didn’t try, it is alright, I don’t want to be so harsh on myself, I was bad when I arrived here and I would not expect a big jump, my personality is also an issue, not in a bad way, I just need to learn how to live with it, find the problem and face it, not avoiding, like right now, I was at the teleferico in porto and I saw I nice rooftop and I really wanted to go there, if it was few weeks ago it would be just a wish, but not, I am sitting at the rooftop right now, writing, waiting for the wine tour, it is really cool, it sounds like nothing, but I now how small stops tier me up, and I cant forget it nor stop it, and in the end it will be only me and myself, always, some people will join my bus during a short period of time and they will leave, you learned how to not get attached to them, knowing the everything is temporary, like everything in life, learning how to say goodbye is essential, for everything, you know what I mean, you are in a good path, I see potential again, after a long winter, don’t lose yourself ever again, it is the best advice I can give you, stay ways close to yourself, a daily meditation would help, routine, I am at the end of my trip, 40 days in total, take one of these days to thing about everything, it will be good to help you incorporate everything that happened, I see that sometimes you have problem with things that it seemed solved few days ago, what make me think that you have learned yet, but the knowledge is there, inside you, it needs to be in front of your issue, you are a man, you don’t look like weird, use that in your advantage, never forget that it could be worst, if you were fat or weirdly ugly, so avoid putting yourself in this hole that sometimes is hard to leave, fake it until you make it, it is simple, like today, it was a battle to remove the hoodie and walk only in t-shirt, but who cares? Yes, your tattoos look weird, so what? Do you want to remove them? I think it would be easy to just accept it, you have heard from different people that they are not that bad, you also got some compliments, from a gay who wanted to fuck you, okay, but, still, it means that it is not all bad, you just to accept it, nothing big, whatever, put something in your mind, nobody cares about you, nobody, positively or negatively, people are mean, they don’t give a fuck about they self,  so do you think they have left bed to pay attemtion to you? Come on, wake up, live your life, in a weird way, but that is you, just live, live for those who cannot live, who are working right now and looking at you and wishing to be you, that is what you should think about, life is not a competition, I am sitting in a really nice place, having good time and this is what matters, don’t forget about the people that love you, even if you are unable to give anything back, you can give time, if it all that you have, just don’t disappear, enjoy everything not only what comes to you.
